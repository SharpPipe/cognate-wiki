> This is when the hero achieves success. After this stage, the hero is no longer the same. The enemy has been defeated, the challenge achieved, and death has been beaten, one way or the other. The reward is the ultimate goal of the hero that is achieved in some form.


## Plan
- Finish the general grading system as well, so that content grading could also be done using out application

## Got done during milestone
- The last time we spend this much time on an milestone was 6 weeks ago
    - This milestone makes up a quarter of the time spend for the last 6 weeks
- Kristjan thought about EPIC issues when he went to the bathroom
    - Epic issues are good, but they tend to drag on for many milestones.
    - New idea is to not mark time spend on the EPIC issues but link the sub-issues in the description.
- Database backup works (somewhat) 🤏
- Backend now uses parellel computing
- Fixed a mess made by Kiili 🐒
- Display more info on projects view
- Feedback comments for teams
- Fixed GitTime graph bugs

## Chat with Ago 🐢
- Repo view needs data about issues
    - begun 
    - completed
    - merge request
    - codelines
- Tree view
    - individual grade
    - team grade
- Dev environment
    - Because monkeying around with live data is scary, we need a live env where we can play around with features
    - Ago will get us a new server
- User flow is cluncky
    - We'll test it and fix it
- Open milestone 4
- Needs export to CSV 


## Planned for next milestone
- Go hard on these issues
- Kristjan made a new EPIC issue


## Difficulties
- 🐞 Kristjan was sick
    - still choughs, but he'll live
- 🐞 Database backup is opinionated
- 🐝 Axios is opinionated about payloads in GET requests
