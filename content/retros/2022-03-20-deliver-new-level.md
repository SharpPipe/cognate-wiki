## Plan
- Add a lot of new graphs
  - All groups results in one graph
  - Results by mentor
- Bring out problem students / groups explicitly to give some early warning

## Got done during milestone
- Lot of bugfixes


## Chat with Ago 🐢
- Ago sounded disapointed because the progress seems halted
- He wants new features 💡
  - Gitlab repo links
  - Issue links 
  - Display same data as the old Kristjan script
  - Admin view for enpoint buttons
  - Feedback comments to grading
    - For whole team 
    - For each dev
  - More transparent grading
  - Time spend Gittime graphs for each repo seperately
- He found a bug where the GitTime graph did not look like it was supposed to on his computer. Mart thought it might be due to the browser locale settings or something
- We should start writing the document sometime soon
- We should integrate last years game project data and this years thesis works data to show to the higher ups.
- He urged us to start working quickly now


## Planned for next milestone
- All the above Ago suggestions
- Aggregate data to show the status of the course overview

## Difficulties
- Kristjan was sick so he was not productive
- Mart helped with the `>init` bootcamp
- There are literally only 24h in a day that is not enough. We should look into time travel.
