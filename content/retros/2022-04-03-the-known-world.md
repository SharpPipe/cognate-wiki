> This is where the hero is living an oblivious life, not realizing his true destiny and the adventure ahead. This is a safe place for the hero, as he lives through his ordinary life.


## Plan
- Add semantic analysis to issue descriptions and factor that into grading.

## Got done during milestone
- 🐝 Refresh token bugs
- 🐝 Confirmation for delete, folowing the _incident_
- 🐝 Gitlab links to reops and repo issues
- 🐞 Increse refresh token lifetime
- 🐞 Recalculate grades
- 🐞 Repo time spent has repo id
- 🐞 Parametric time spent


## Chat with Ago 🐢
- Ago didn't suspect anything 
    - _we have not done as much work as we wanted_
- More data in project view
- `/group/6/repo/246` -> `/group/6/project/246`
- Groups view should have criteria next to grades
- Bring out naughty mentors who give unfair points
- He want's to use our software to analyze last years data
- Improve our feedback form so that we can use it in our thesis
- He wants CSV
- He wants to setup entire group from frontend


## Planned for next milestone
- Usability overhaul
- Perfomance improvements
- More color

## Difficulties
- Old age
- Sickness
- Backend monkey did his work at the end of the milestone, so the frontend monkey could not do his work. 
- Foot issues
