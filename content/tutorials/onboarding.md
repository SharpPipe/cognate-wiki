### So you want to develop Cognate
1. Pic a emoji to identify yourself. We use emojis to not have to write out peoples names. And it is more fun that way also. 
    - The emojis that are picked already are Kristjan 🐞, Mart 🐝, Ago 🐢 and Raud 🐒 so you have to choose some others
2. If you are unfamiliar with Django, Vue or D3 then check out our gathered resources at [Help -> Tutorials](/tutorials/tutorials)
3. Make sure you are familiar with the usual Devops cycle. Each week we talk to the mentor and demo the changes. If he approves then we make a big merge request to push the develop branch to main (live env). After that we will write a retro.
4. The basic git workflow looks like this:
    1. Make issue
    2. Create MR from issue in GitLab
    3. git fetch
    4. git checkout the new branch
    5. develop, develop, develop until your eyes start bleeding
    6. Create commits periotically with commit messges that start with an hash and the issue number (ex: **#14 Fix the other developers mess**)
    7. If all your developments are done then push them to remote
    8. Go to the GitLab MR that was made from the issue and **Mark as ready** then send the MR to an other team member to review
    9. If the other team member approves of the changes then he may merge the thing
5. Relax in your deathbed knowing that you made some students breathe easier in your lifetime
